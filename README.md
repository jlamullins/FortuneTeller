# FortuneTeller

A mini project created just for fun. This website is inspired by the old game of Mash and paper fortune tellers.
We predict the user's future by asking a few questions.

This website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Php, and Bootstrap.

This mini project was created for fun by Jessica Mullins. Code was developed using the following resources: 
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>, <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/">Start Bootstrap</a>, 
various posts from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and some of Jessica's previous projects.
The color scheme was selected using <a href="http://www.paletton.com">Paletton</a>. 

Feel free to check out the finished project <a href="http://www.jessicamullins.com/fortuneTeller">here</a>.
